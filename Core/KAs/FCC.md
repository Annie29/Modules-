# Fundamental Cloud Concepts - FCC

Cloud Computing has gained significant momentum in the last five
years and is regarded as a paradigm shift away from traditional ’silo’
based computing. Students have already had significant exposure
to using the cloud through products like social media, email, remote
storage, and online games even though they may not recognize
that these items use cloud resources.

This KA introduces the fundamental concepts and gives a general
overview of the cloud. Students will learn the specific advantages
and disadvantages of the cloud over on-premises resources. Stu-
dents will be exposed to the business model of the cloud, including
examination of the true cost of on-premises resources. Students
will also be introduced to the different layers in the cloud stack and
examples of different cloud stacks. Students will analyze several
case studies of companies that use the different layers of cloud
stacks to meet their business requirements.

Each of the following Learning Objectives links to a list of materials that can be used to teach the LO.

## Conceptual Learning Objectives

* [FCC-CL1](LOs/FCC-CL1.md): Define the cloud computing concept, its history and motivation.	 
* [FCC-CL2](LOs/FCC-CL2.md): Name widely-used cloud-based systems and explain the advantages of having the system on the cloud.	 
* [FCC-CL3](LOs/FCC-CL3.md): Define virtualization of computing, storage, and networking resources.	 
* [FCC-CL4](LOs/FCC-CL4.md): Explain the differences between leasing versus ownership of compute resources and compare the total cost of ownership.	 
* [FCC-CL5](LOs/FCC-CL5.md): Discuss some of the advantages and disadvantages of the cloud paradigm when compared to on-premise resources.	 
* [FCC-CL6](LOs/FCC-CL6.md): Discuss the implications of utilizing on-premise versus off-premise compute resources.	 
* [FCC-CL7](LOs/FCC-CL7.md): Articulate the economic benefits as well as issues/risks of the cloud paradigm for both cloud providers and users.	 
* [FCC-CL8](LOs/FCC-CL8.md): Compare and contrast the types of cloud service models.	 
* [FCC-CL9](LOs/FCC-CL9.md): Define service level objectives, agreements and their implications on migrating a solution to a cloud service provider.	 
* [FCC-CL10](LOs/FCC-CL10.md): Enumerate and explain various threats in cloud security.	 
* [FCC-CL11](LOs/FCC-CL11.md): Analyze a case study about a cloud-based system.	 

## Experiental Learning Objectives

* [FCC-EL1](LOs/FCC-EL1.md): Recognize existing VM templates provided on a particular cloud infrastructure.	 
* [FCC-EL2](LOs/FCC-EL2.md): Explain alternative methods of interacting with provisioned resources (e.g., CLI, GUI, API). Browse, identify, and access resources through a GUI and the CLI.	 
* [FCC-EL3](LOs/FCC-EL3.md): Create and format virtual storage units.	 
* [FCC-EL4](LOs/FCC-EL4.md): Demonstrate attaching virtual storage units to VM instances.	 
* [FCC-EL5](LOs/FCC-EL5.md): Copy data from local storage to the cloud.	 
* [FCC-EL6](LOs/FCC-EL6.md): Demonstrate creating a VM, and provisioning it with compute, memory and storage options. Demonstrate starting, stopping and deleting a VM instance.
