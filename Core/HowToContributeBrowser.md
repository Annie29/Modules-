# How to contribute using a browser

## Overview of updating content with browser

Log into your GitHub account from a browser.

Open a browser and go to the main GitHub repo [cloudcomputingCurriculum](https://github.com/cloudcomputingcurricula/Cloud-Computing-Curricula).

### Fork the repo
- Fork this repo by using the "Fork" button at the top of the screen.

If you've previously forked the repo, instead you will need to do [a pull request to update your copy of the repo to match the main repo](https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/wiki/Syncing-your-fork-to-the-original-repository-via-the-browser).

### Make your changes
- You may edit files directly in the browser.
  - To edit an existing file (such as `Contributions.md`), navigate to the file and click the pencil at the top of the file.
  - To add a new file, navigate to the appropriate folder and select `Create new file`.  
    - There is no ability to copy a file in GitHub, so to make a copy of `Module.md`, it's easier to create a new file and cut and paste the contents into a new file.
- Please see [this document](HowToContributeBasic.md) for instructions on formatting your changes.
- As you finish editing each document, commit your changes by navigating to the bottonm of the page, filling in information in the _Commit changes_ section, and clicking "Commit changes." 
- If you want to add your material to GitHub directly, as opposed to just providing a link, upload them to the `UploadContent` folder in the `Content Folder`. 

### Submit a pull request 
- Once you are done with all changes, click on the "New Pull Request" button at the top of the main repo page.
- Ensure that the direction of the pull is to `base repository: cloudcomputingcurricula/Cloud-Computing-Curricula, base:master` from your repo.
- If you have changes, you will see “Able to merge” notification and will be able to commit by clicking on ”Create pull request” button. 
  - Enter any comments necessary and click the “Create pull request” button again.
