## Cloud Computing Resources

### Details

An ACM SiGCSE Working Group titled "Toward Developing a Cloud Computing Model Curriculum" is exploring the current state of adoption of cloud computing across different computing courses and programs across a broad range of international Higher Education institutions. The Working Group will convene at the 24th Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education [ITiCSE 2019](https://iticse.acm.org/). 

More information about the working group (WG7) is at https://iticse.acm.org/working-group-details/#WG7, with group member details here: [link]

## Cloud Computing Curriculum Survey 

We are an ITiCSE 2019 working group on developing a cloud computing curriculum. We are running a survey to learn about existing cloud-related courses.  Please take 5-10 minutes to fill this survey about cloud-related courses at your institution: [Cloud Survey 2019](https://forms.gle/MYz2iX5J8UBigwQG7)
