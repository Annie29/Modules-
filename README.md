## Cloud Computing Resources

### Details

The ACM SiGCSE Working Group titled "Toward Developing a Cloud Computing Model Curriculum" is exploring the current state of adoption of cloud computing across different technology-focused courses and programs in a broad range of international Higher Education institutions. The Working Group will convene at the 24th Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education [ITiCSE 2019](https://iticse.acm.org/). More information about the working group (WG7) is available [here](https://iticse.acm.org/working-group-details/#WG7), with group member details [here.](/Core/wgmembers.md)

## Goal

To create a community focused on sharing cloud computing resources for teaching

## Cloud Computing Curriculum Survey 

 The group is running a survey to learn about existing cloud-related courses.  Please take 5-10 minutes to fill this survey about cloud-related courses at your institution: [Cloud Survey 2019](https://forms.gle/MYz2iX5J8UBigwQG7)

## Publications

The paper 'Cloud computing: developing contemporary computer science curriculum for a cloud-first future' was published by the working group in 2018 and led to the creation of Knowledge Areas for developing cloud computing curricula.
