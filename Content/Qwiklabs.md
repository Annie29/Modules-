# Qwiklabs

## Summary

Hands-on labs for AWS and GCP that come with pre-provisioned accounts so there's no need to 
have an account on these services and no danger of leaving resources running.  Groups labs together 
into Quests that provide badges for completion.  Lab difficulty ranges from introductory to 
expert/certification prep exercises.

There is a charge for many of the labs/quests but approved academic GCP users can request [credits 
for GCP labs/Quests](/Content/GCP.md).
